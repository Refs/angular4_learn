* grap the http library | grap the forms module

```ts
// in app.module.ts



```


* create a new folder `shared`  and folder 'shared/models'

```bash

cd src/app/
mkdir shared 
mkdir shared/models

```

> in the models folder we can create user class ,so we can use that class across whole application . we are going to list users, creating users, updating users. it makes sense to have a user model so that we know what a user object looks like   
* create user.model.ts
